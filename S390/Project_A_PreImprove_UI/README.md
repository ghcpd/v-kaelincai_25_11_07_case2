Project A - Pre-Improvement UI (Modal)\n\nThis demo reproduces the original problematic modal: eager-loading of tags, members, and attachments; important fields (Title/Due) are placed lower in the form.\n\nHow to run:\n1. Windows PowerShell: `cd Project_A_PreImprove_UI`\n2. `setup.sh` (create venv & install dependencies)\n3. `run_tests.sh 1` (run tests, 1 repeat)\n\nArtifacts:\n- `screenshots/` contains the screenshot captures for each test case;\n- `logs/` has server logs: `log_pre.txt`; \n- `results/` contains `results_pre.json` with metrics.\n
